# TBSI Sunwoda Battery Dataset
Sunwoda Electronic Co., Ltd, generates the TBSI Sunwoda Battery Dataset. The collaboration team at Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI) performs the main research work. We open-source this dataset to inspire more data-driven battery management research.
This is a multi-stage fast charging, i.e., 20 minutes for 75% state of charge, dataset for a ternary lithium-ion battery with a cathode material of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811). The anode material of the battery is graphite containing 13 wt% of silicon oxide for better energy density purposes with a rated capacity of 1.1 Ah. The batteries were cycled under 9-step fast charging (0.33C to 3C, where 1C is 1.1A) and 1C constant discharge conditions. After setting fixed state of charge (SOC) interval for each step, the battery was charged by applying constant currents with different C rates, aiming to achieve fast charging while reducing lithium plating.
